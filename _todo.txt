Prio 1:
- adding meal to day should be standalone meal in database (customizable). Maybe it should be : add from predefined, add from scratch
- add button and style to right top corner links

Prio 2:
- Edit and delete icon should have tooltip
- Add breadcrumbs
- all destroy views should hold @csrf and @method('delete')
- allow to update water drinking eg. divide daily requirement by 12 hours and add button 'Done'
- list of products assigned to meal should be listed in show action instead of edit
- product can have nullable fields - if null then its not filled in - put warning there
- product list should show protein, carbs etc.
- add select2 (or similar) to better search products and meals

Prio 3:
- Route - move meal-products to resource route by hiding meal_id in form
- add salt (like fiber and sugar)
- Products must have a category: nabiał, mięso etc.
- Products should contain tags like: wysokobiałkowy etc.
- dashboard - use common view (probably only table) for day (with days)
- create/edit product and my goal - sugar cant be higher than carbs

To consider:
- create dashboard with TODAY + water + some graphs
- modals should appear definitely
- need to separate protein from animal and plant etc. and count it together but mention how many on each source
- add body dimensions + ask for update (eg. every 7 days) + set goal for body dimension
